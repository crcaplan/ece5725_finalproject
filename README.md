ECE 5725 Final Project

This project uses a Raspberry Pi to function as a jukebox that scans a user’s specific QR code identifier and  
plays music from their custom playlist. Additionally, once the music is playing, it uses IR and ultrasonic sensors to provide
gesture-based control of play/pause, fast forwarding/reversing songs, and volume. On the PiTFT screen, the Raspberry Pi 
will also display the song queue of the playlist, including information about the songs such as name, length, and artist.
The song will then be played on a speaker over the Raspberry Pi’s audio jack.
